neon is a real time stock trading and monitoring app. It uses web sockets to
connect to TD Ameritrade and monitor stocks. It then uses python and machine
learning to predict changes and try to make a profit. Phoenix live view is used
for the views for live updating.

neon is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/btkostner/neon) and uses GitHub
actions for testing.
